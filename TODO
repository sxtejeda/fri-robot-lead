Lots of stuff to do!

Visual Confirmation

	Two options here:

		Use the Velodyne Sensor:
	
			Could potentially allow for the robot to walk side by side with the person, which could be pretty neat.
			Not sure how hard it would be to implement that though.

		Use the webcam:

			Probably the easier solution, there are lots of algorithms already out there for detecting people?
			We'll also get the chance to implement distance I think?
			
Improved GUI

	new GUI should be a lot better than the dropdown menu. I think there should still be a dropdown menu,
	that should not be the only part here. A user should be able to type in the room number I think,
	there should also be functionality for going to a room based upon the name of the office (e.g. Jivko's
	), which would require just an editable text box?

Multifloor Navigation

	The seemingly impossible task over here. Lots of issues going on.
		
	The way I see the overall thought process at the moment:

		User selects the room. Then, it needs to be decided whether or not this room is on the current floor that
		the robot resides. If it is, then it should execute the current code, which sends the robot to that
		room. Otherwise, there should be a completely different execution, one that sends the robot to the
		elevator. Upon reaching the elevator, there are a number of other issues, notably getting the robot into
		the actual elevator (since its sensors make it hard for the robot to enter a crowded elevator) and then
		having it select the new map. We're gonna have to have the robot just trust that the user won't lie to the
		robot and will help it get out of the elevator on the correct floor, but it should be able to help
		the user select the correct floor as well. From there, somehow it needs to select the correct map. After
		that, the robot will execute the normal program, which sends it to the correct room.
